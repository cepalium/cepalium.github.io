title: Coronavirus Pandemic
---

*Disclaimer:* This post is not about how COVID-19 originated or how different countries reacted against the outbreak. This post documents my own experience during this pandemic in Germany 2020.

I started reading news about a novel virus in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 during my preparation back to Germany in early January 2020. It catched my attention as I have a long transit in Beijing and I planned to go out of the airport. When I arrived at Beijing, everything seemed to be running normal, and I had quality time visiting the city fortunately.

After I reached home in Germany one-day after, things escalated quickly. China confirmed her 1st case, then performed restrictions in Wuhan immediately. I noticed some Chinese students wearing masks right at that time.

People over the world, not only the Sinosphere region, sensed the early presence of the virus. Mockery, blame, ignorance and racism were sent to China and her people on the Internet first. That attitude is not right and saddened. The "fire" eventually blew up. The harmful (inter)actions were done on Sinosphere people, I experienced it myself too.

In the next 2 months, I started a new job in a new city, and finding a new accomodation was really difficult. Luckily enough, I found one, and I worked from home most of the time with minimum going-outside since. 

There were some bright sides. I read the most books I have ever read in the span of 3 months in my life before. I accomplished my project goals. I discovered my taste for music and movies. And I restarted this blog.

At the time I am writing this post, the pandemic is not over. It is not even close to over yet.

Life is full of storms and they are never going easy. I'm keeping my hope that the sun will shine bright soon.
