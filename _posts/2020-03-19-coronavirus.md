title: Coronavirus Pandemic

*Disclaimer:* This post is not about how COVID-19 originated or how different countries reacted against the outbreak. This post documents my own experience during this pandemic.

I started reading news about a novel virus in Wuhan, China in late December 2019 during my preparation back to Germany in early January 2020. I cared for this topic because I have a long transit in Beijing and I planed to go out. When I arrived at Beijing, everything seemed to be running normal, and I had quality time there, fortunately.

I reached my home in Germany, and things escalated quickly. China confirmed her 1st case, then performed restrictions right after. Some East-Asian students wearing masks in the very beginning stage in my place, which is not commonly seen in Germany.

I felt that people over the world, not only the Sinosphere region, sensed the early presence of the virus. Full of mockery, blame, ignorance and racism to China in the Internet. That attitude solely is not right, and sad. The fire eventually blew up. The bad actions were taken on Sinosphere people. I experienced it.

In the couple of months next, I started a new job in a new city. Finding a new accomodation was difficult and I worked from home nearly all the time with minimum going-outside.

There is still some good news from me. In 3 months, I defended an important project in my study. I read the most books I ever read in 3 months. I accomplished my job project goals. I reviewed my music taste and watched some movies in my pending list. I started this blog.

At the time I am writing this post, the pandemic is not over. It is not even close.

Life is full of storms and they are never going easy. Keep my hope high that the sun will shine again.
