Ubuntu is my 1st ever Linux distro because all blogs which I read that time listed Ubuntu on top for Linux beginner. Honestly, experiencing Ubuntu is a pain in the neck.

My impression of Ubuntu is the Terminal and its software center. I can install apps from those portals, which is a real convenience.

After the installation, Ubuntu ran smoothly for some weeks without any error. Then the problems came more and more frequently. Those problems were:

thumbnail cache error
audio could not play
I suddenly couldn’t open new app/windows
sudo apt-get update refused to work because system file became only-read, and so on.
The only solution is to reboot, and everytime the system would boot into BusyBox, where I can do the command

fsck /dev/sdaX 
to fix those orphaned inodes, then reboot again. At first, the period of BusyBox occurence is some day, then shorter and shorter, until a few times in an hour!

I thought the problem was caused due to the dual-boot of Windows and Ubuntu, but it wasn’t (I realized this by Linux Mint). It seemed that the updates of Ubuntu made the system unstable. I ditched Ubuntu and came back to use only Windows for a while.
