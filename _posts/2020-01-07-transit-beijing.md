Some observations and experience from my international transit in Beijing Capital International Airport in January 2020:

* Most of nationalities could transit in Beijing up to 24 hours without a visa
* Most of nationalities could apply for a 24-Hour Transit-without-visa to go outside the airport
* It takes around 2 hours to apply for the Transit-without-visa and to pass the Immigration Check (there was a very long queue at the Immigration Check, the longest I have ever experienced)
* It takes 25-30 minutes to travel by Express City train from the airport to Dongzhinem station. From there, switch to another subway line to arrive at your desired destination
* The Express City train runs from 6AM to 11PM. Watch your time.
* The subway in rush hours is packed of people
* Attraction points have police officers everywhere and you need to show your passport to enter
* Forbidden City costs 40 Yuan in winter, and 80 Yuan in summer
* CCTV everywhere, and people, too
* When you enter a subway station, you also need to do a security check
* If your layover time is more than 10 hours, highly recommend you to check out and do a city tour. If not, pick the 3-hour transit for not waiting too long during transfer
* If you have 1-day transit, better pick 1: only Beijing center or the Great Wall. Donâ€™t try both without travel agency or Chinese language fluency
* It takes around 1 hour to transfer in Terminal 3 of this Beijing airport
* It is better to prepare some Yuan beforehand, because exchanging money at the airport has a high fee
* Air China is Chinese, China Airlines is Taiwanese, Southern China Airlines is Chinese: mind is blown with these names
