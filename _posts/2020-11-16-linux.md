## Elementary OS

At the beginning of 2020, I moved from Manjaro Linux to Elementary OS because I was attracted to its desktop resembling MacOS. But it is another Ubuntu-based distro, so the same trouble eventually showed up.

## Solus

Solus is the next distro after Elementary OS. The first problem I encountered is no Solus boot option added in UEFI after the installation, so I (or any user) need to add it manually in the bootable USB section. Solus is the first of its bloodline since it is built from sratch but not branched from any major family. Let me see how long it takes for the bugs to emerge on my veteran laptop.
