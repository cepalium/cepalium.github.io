title: Hello World
---

Prior to this space, I was running another blog page `tuannotes.com`. Everything there was already on set from the first glance: hosting by Bluehost, blogging by Wordpress. The major work could only be blog writing, and some customization.

However, I was not totally satisfied with it. The service was paid to use. The shared hosting took long time for loading a page. Wordpress is a Content Management System, and I yearned something more concise and lightweight. The page was blocked in some circumstances (e.g Wordpress page block).

Moreover, I felt an invisible pressure to produce posts every week. I was obsessed with sharing my knowledge and experience to whomever reached there.

Then came a spark. My knowledge is just a glass of water. Without me, there are other people sharing their knowledge better. There are books and peer-reviewed materials which are eventually much better in explaining those concepts. I should not spend any more of time to make duplicates. I shall make a thing that captures my pure intent from the beginning.

A thing with simplicity, longevity and memory.

Cepalium, hello to the world.
