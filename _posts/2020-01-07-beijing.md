I decided to visit Beijing for half a day, as having an international transit here. I was firstly unsure doing this trip in a capital of the most crowded country without language and Internet. Turning out, it was an open-minded experience, which I was particularly impressed with the ancient attractions in a fast-developling metropolitan.

Arriving home, the song "Beijing Welcomes You" of 2008 Olympic reminds me of the city.

This is the beginning of 2020. A year of fires, warmongers, pandemic, racism and riots worldwide.
