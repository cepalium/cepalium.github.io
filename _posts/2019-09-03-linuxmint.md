title: Linux Mint

This time, I made up my mind to ditch Windows totally. Therefore, I formatted drive C, where stores all Windows system folders, and installed Linux Mint Cinnamon alone.

Linux Mint Cinnamon desktop environment was beautiful. I liked this interface, in contrast of Ubuntu using Gnome. 

My experience with Mint was nice for another some first weeks, then the same problems of Ubuntu came again. At then, I realized that the problem was caused from the updates of the system (e.g application updates, kernel updates). At a point, Mint was even worse than Ubuntu, in which Google Chrome was automatically crashed.

Therefore, I decided to re-install Linux Mint and kept it there without update. The system ran well, really. But living without updates is not a good choice in long term. During this time, I did some research in Linux to find a next distro. Ubuntu is Debian-based, and Mint is Ubuntu-based. This motivated me to move to another family of Linux.
