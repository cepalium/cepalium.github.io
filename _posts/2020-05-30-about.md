I am Tuan Nguyen. As a person, I have multiple hobbies, each of them fighting others to get the time. At once, I tasted a wide variety of beer to pick up my favorite.

Cepalium is my self-originated nickname. A combination of "cepa" (onion) and "alium" (garlic) in Latin, because I have them in meals everyday.
