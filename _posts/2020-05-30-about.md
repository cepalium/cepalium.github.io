I am Tuan Nguyen. My education background covers Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Beside that, I have multiple hobbies, each fighting others to get the free time slot. At once, I tasted a wide variety of beer to pick up my favorite.

Cepalium is a self-originated nickname. A combination of "cepa" (onion) and "alium" (garlic) in Latin, because I have them in meals everyday.
