## Ubuntu

If you follow Linux forums/websites, Ubuntu is placed as top Linux to go for beginners. Thus, I was biased to have Ubuntu as my first Linux distro installed. It was at the end of year 2018.

My first impression for Ubuntu is its nice User Interface. I was a little surprised when comparing it to Windows. But the key point to keep me visiting Ubuntu is the Terminal. It was simply different experience from Windows, whose Command Prompt and PowerShell I barely touched. Ubuntu ran smoothly for a couple of weeks.

After the honeymoon, the storm arrived:

* Thumbnail cache error
* Could not play audio
* Could not open new app
* System files became read-only

The list kept going on. The only solution was to reboot, and everytime it booted into the `BusyBox`. At first, the error interval was in days, then eventually to a few times a day.

The trouble source seemed to be Ubuntu updates, which made the system unstable. I was not sure at that time. I deleted Ubuntu and came back to Windows.

## Linux Mint

In the middle of 2019, I made up my mind to ditch Windows totally: deteled Windows partition and installed only Linux Mint Cinnamon on my machine.

Linux Mint desktop environment was much more beautiful (subjectively) than Ubuntu's. Mint was nice for a couple of weeks (sounds somehow same?), then the same Ubuntu problems emerged again (now it's the same). At a point, Mint was worse than Ubuntu, when Google Chrome suddenly crashed without a reason.

I had a firm feeling that the updates caused those problems. Therefore, I decided to clean-install Linux Mint and kept it away from updates. The system ran really well then.

However, living without updates is not a my long-term option. Ubuntu is Debian-based, and Mint is Ubuntu-based. This motivated me to move to another family of Linux distros.

## Manjaro Linux

I catched the names of Manjaro Linux and Arch Linux on some forums. Arch Linux was introduced as a cutting-edge distro, which makes it unstable, and Manjaro Linux is Arch-based with a little more stability thanks to the team behind it. Installing Arch is a pain in the neck, while installing Manjaro is the same process as Ubuntu/Linux Mint. Therefore, I continue my Linux journey with Manjaro Linux.

Using Arch-based distro was strange at first, but I soon turned to be its fan. The different experience from Ubuntu are: Manjaro uses `pacman`, Ubuntu uses `apt-get` for package management. Ubuntu has the software center, while Manjaro has the package center. In addition, Manjaro has active supporting communities, like the Manjaro Wiki and Arch Wiki.

However, the baddies appeared sooner or later:

* Nvidia: Nvidia card works perfectly on Windows. Nvidia driver is installed on Ubuntu with ease. But installing Nvidia drivers in Manjaro Linux is not that straightforward. An approach is to use Optimus Manager with some configuration on boot.
* The screen suddenly freezes while using Google Chrome.
* Could not connect to WiFi broadcast by a repeater after power-on. A solution is to reset the repeater then.

At the beginning of 2020, I said goodbye to Manjaro Linux, and started using Elementary OS.
