Frankfurt am Main is the first city of my journey in Germany. I was here 5 months for my bachelor thesis at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. It was in spring and summer of 2018. The sky was high and clear.

Public transportation in Frankfurt is a gift with multiple options from train, tram, bus, and flight. Besides, Frankfurt is geographically central of Germany and Europe, which helps a lot in travelling.

Most important, my bachelor thesis was successully defended with the help of supportive supervisors and dear friends.

Thank you, Frankfurt.
