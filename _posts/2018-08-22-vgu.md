title: Vietnamese German University

*Disclaimer:* This is my experience at Vietnamese German University (VGU) as an Electrical Engineering & Information Technology undergraduate student 2014-2018.

It was in my 11th grade that I first heard about VGU. I took its TestAS Entrance Exam to test my ability in a new exam format that I was not trained for (it is a IQ & logic test, different from Vietnam University Exams). When I got the acceptance letter, my father were jumping happily. 

Fast forward, VGU has become a part of me. I was a member of 2 major clubs and made cool friends there. I lived in the dorm, where I met my precious roommates as my second family. VGU opened the door to Germany for me, so I could explore the world (although there was no scholarship for my class due to administration mistake - a bit saddened).

How could I rate a university, particularly VGU? It is not always the uni's number on published rankings. It is how good you become from that university. And we have a saying: “VGU is Very Good University”. 

Thank you, VGU.
