## Elementary OS

At the beginning of 2020, I moved from Manjaro Linux to Elementary OS. I was attracted to its desktop which resembles MacOS. But it is a Ubuntu-based distro, so the same problems I had with Ubuntu came back eventually.

## Solus

Solus was my next distro after Elementary OS. A notable positive is the smooth installation and function of NVIDIA drivers. However, Solus does not install its boot option in UEFI (I had to add it manually) and WiFi is off for every interval of time (even though I had the WiFi powersave disabled). 

## Fedora

Fedora is the last distro I tried in 2020. A minus is it does not have non-free codecs pre-installed, so videos cannot be played in the browser. Even installing the codecs or browsers from Flatpak, the videos keep showing the sad face. Using Firefox from source does the job, but then one more step of creating the launcher is necessary for later convenience.
