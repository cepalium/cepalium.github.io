title: Thank you, Frankfurt

Frankfurt am Main is the first city of my journey in Germany. I spent here 5 months to conduct the bachelor thesis at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences.

It was in spring and summer of 2018. The sky was high and clear, compared to the gray and snowy in the winter.

Public transportation in Frankfurt is a gift with multiple options from train, tram, bus, and flight. Besides, Frankfurt is geographically central of Germany and Europe, which helps a lot in travelling.

Most importantly, my bachelor thesis was successully done with the help from supportive supervisors and dear friends.

Thank you, Frankfurt.
